## Project Description
Hospitals keep patient records in paper files which is cumbersome and inefficient. In some cases, doctors spend more time looking for patient files than with the actual patient. The healthcare industry has a lot of paper trail which can take away from the time doctors spend with their patients. Having an efficient management tool can help improve patient and doctor experience.
